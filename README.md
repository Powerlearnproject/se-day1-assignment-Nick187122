Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a. Birth of Software Engineering (1968 – NATO Conference): The term Software Engineering was first coined at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968. One of the impacts of this is that it led to the introduction of software development methodologies, including the Waterfall Model for structured programming.
b. The Rise of Agile Methodology (2001 – Agile Manifesto): In 2001, a group of software developers created the Agile Manifesto, introducing a flexible and iterative approach to software development. Impacts of this is that it led to the widespread adoption of Scrum, Kanban, DevOps, and other agile frameworks and also improved software development speed, adaptability, and customer satisfaction.
c. The Emergence of DevOps and Automation (2010s – Present): The DevOps movement emerged in the 2010s to bridge the gap between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). Impacts of this is that it reduced software deployment times from months to days or even minutes and improved software quality, security, and reliability through automated testing and monitoring.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a. Planning: Defining project scope, objectives, feasibility, and required resources.
b. Requirement Analysis: Gathering and documenting functional and non-functional requirements.
c. Design: Creating a blueprint for software architecture and system components.
d. Development also known as implementation: Writing code and building the software based on design specifications.
e. Testing: Ensuring the software is functional, secure, and free from defects.
f. Deployment: Releasing the software for end users or clients.
g. Maintenance and Support: Ensuring software remains functional, secure, and up-to-date.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
a. In terms of Approach, Waterfall method is	sequential, structured, and phase-based while in Agile method it is	iterative, flexible, and adaptive
b. In Waterfall method there are well	defined phases while in Agile method there are continuous cycles (sprints) with frequent reassessments
c. The Waterfall method is rigid and difficult to change requirements once a phase is completed	while in Agile, it is highly flexible and allows changes throughout development.
d. The user involvement	is minimal in Waterfall method and feedback is gathered after the final product is delivered while in Agile methos it is high and there is continuous collaboration with stakeholders
e. Testing is done after development is completed in Waterfall method while in Agile method continuous testing throughout the process.
